All processing is performed in memory during the request.  
No data is saved to a database or persistent storage.

## Purpose of the data
The YouTube URL is used only to:
- Retrieve the chapter-wise transcript for the video
- Return it to the GPT so that the user can receive summaries and insights

No profiling, marketing, or analytics are performed.

## Third-party services
The backend fetches video transcripts from YouTube.  
Users are responsible for ensuring they have rights to access and process the video content.
